# Weather App

Code examples for the article "[How to minimize docker image size: 4 key approaches](https://notes.hatedabamboo.me/minimizing-containerized-applications/)"

This repository consists of five levels of Docker image rarity, each consecutively more efficient and, at times, more complex.

The application is written in Python, but for the Legendary level, it has been rewritten in Golang to compile it into a static binary.

To run the application, replace `YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY` string in `app.py`/`app.go`.
